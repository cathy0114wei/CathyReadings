> 我们的意思是说，人首先是存在——人在谈得上别的一切之前，首先是一个把自己推向未来的东西，并且感觉到自己在这样做。
> 
> For we mean to say that man primarily exists – that man is, before all else, something **which propels itself towards a future** and is aware that it is doing so.

> 因为实际上，人为了把自己造成他愿意成为的那种人而可能采取的一切行动中，没有一个行动不是同时在创造一个他认为自己应当如此的人的形象。在这一形象或那一形象之间作出选择的同时，他也就肯定了所选择的形象的价值；因为我们不能选择更坏的。我们选择的总是更好的；而且对我们说来，如果不是对大家都是更好的，那还有什么是更好的呢？
> 
> For in effect, of all the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as **he believes he ought to be**. To choose between this or that is at the same time to **affirm the value of that which is chosen**; for we are unable ever to choose the worse. What we choose is always the better; and nothing can be better for us unless it is better for all.

> 我要人人都安分守己，因此我的行动是代表全人类承担责任。
> 
> 在模铸自己时，我模铸了人。
>
>Resignation is my will for everyone, and my action is, in consequence, a commitment on behalf of all mankind.
>
>**In fashioning myself I fashion man.**

>陀思妥耶夫斯基有一次写道：“如果上帝不存在，什么事情都将是容许的。”这对存在主义说来，就是起点。的确，如果上帝不存在，一切都是容许的，因此人就变得孤苦伶仃了，因为他不论在自己的内心里或者在自身以外，都找不到可以依靠的东西。他会随即发现他是找不到借口的。因为如果存在确是先于本质，人就永远不能参照一个已知的或特定的人性来解释自己的行动，换言之，决定论是没有的——人是自由的，人就是自由。

>Dostoevsky once wrote: “If God did not exist, everything would be permitted”; and that, for existentialism, is the starting point. Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist, and man is in consequence forlorn, for he cannot find anything to depend upon either within or outside himself. He discovers forthwith, that he is without excuse. For if indeed existence precedes essence, one will never be able to explain one’s action by reference to a given and specific human nature; in other words, there is no determinism – man is free, man *is* freedom.

>他得在这两者之间作出抉择。有什么能帮助他选择呢？没有。基督教的教义说：对人要慈善，要爱你的邻人，要为别人克制你自己，**选择最艰苦的道路，等等。但是什么是最艰苦的道路？**谁应当承受这种兄弟般的爱呢？是爱国者，还是那个母亲？哪一个目的比较有用呢？是参加整个社会斗争这个一般性的目的，还是帮助某一特定的人生活下去的具体目的？谁能够先天地回答这个问题？没有人。而且任何伦理学文献里也没有规定过。康德的伦理学说，**永远不要把另一个人当作手段，而要当作目的**。如果我和我母亲呆在一起，我就是把她当作一个目的，而不是当作一个手段：但是根据同样理由，那些为我战斗的人就有被我当作手段的危险；反过来也是一样，如果我去帮助那些战士，我将是把他们当作目的，而犯了把我母亲当作手段的危险。

>Consequently, he found himself confronted by two very different modes of action; the one concrete, immediate, but directed towards only one individual; and the other an action addressed to an end infinitely greater, a national collectivity, but for that very reason ambiguous – and it might be frustrated on the way. At the same time, he was hesitating between two kinds of morality; on the one side the morality of sympathy, of personal devotion and, on the other side, a morality of wider scope but of more debatable validity. He had to choose between those two. What could help him to choose? Could the Christian doctrine? No. Christian doctrine says: Act with charity, love your neighbour, deny yourself for others, choose the way which is hardest, and so forth. But which is the harder road? To whom does one owe the more brotherly love, the patriot or the mother? Which is the more useful aim, the general one of fighting in and for the whole community, or the precise aim of helping one particular person to live? Who can give an answer to that a priori? No one. Nor is it given in any ethical scripture. The Kantian ethic says, Never regard another as a means, but always as an end. Very well; if I remain with my mother, I shall be regarding her as the end and not as a means: but by the same token I am in danger of treating as means those who are fighting on my behalf; and the converse is also true, that if I go to the aid of the combatants I shall be treating them as the end at the risk of treating my mother as a means.

>换句话说，情感是由人的行为形成的；所以我不能参照我的情感来指导行动。而这就是说我既不能从内心里找到一个真正的行动冲力，也不能指望从什么伦理学里找到什么能帮助我行动的公式。你可以说那个青年至少还找上一位教授向他请教。但是如果你向人请教——例如向牧师请教——**你已经选上那个牧师了**；归根到底，你多多少少已经知道他将会给你什么忠告了。换句话说，在你选择一个人向他请教时，你作这项选择就已经承担责任了。

>In other words, feeling is formed by the deeds that one does; therefore I cannot consult it as a guide to action. And that is to say that I can neither seek within myself for an authentic impulse to action, nor can I expect, from some ethic, formulae that will enable me to act. You may say that the youth did, at least, go to a professor to ask for advice. But if you seek counsel – from a priest, for example you have selected that priest; and at bottom you already knew, more or less, what he would advise. In other words, to choose an adviser is nevertheless to commit oneself by that choice.

>但是实际上，而且在存在主义者看来，离开爱的行动是没有爱的；离开了爱的那些表现，是没有爱的潜力的；天才，除掉艺术作品中所表现的之外，是没有的。普鲁斯特的天才就表现在他的全部作品中；拉辛的天才就表现在他的一系列悲剧中，此外什么都没有。为什么我们要说拉辛有能力再写一部悲剧，而这部悲剧恰恰是他没有写的呢？**一个人投入生活，给自己画了像，除了这个画像外，什么都没有。**当然，这种思想对于那些一生中没有取得成就的人是有点不好受的。另一方面，这却使人人都容易理解到只有实际情况是可靠的；梦、期望、希望只能作为幻灭的梦、夭折的希望、没有实现的期望来解释人；这就是说，只能从反面，而不是从正面来解释。虽说如此，当一个人说，“你除掉你的生活之外，更无别的”，这并不意味着说一个画家只能就他的作品来估计他，因为还有千百件其他的事情同样有助于解释他的为人。这话的意思就是说，一个人不多不少就是他的一系列行径；他是构成这些行径的总和、组织和一套关系。

>But in reality and for the existentialist, there is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art. The genius of Proust is the totality of the works of Proust; the genius of Racine is the series of his tragedies, outside of which there is nothing. Why should we attribute to Racine the capacity to write yet another tragedy when that is precisely what he did not write? In life, a man commits himself, draws his own portrait and there is nothing but that portrait. No doubt this thought may seem comfortless to one who has not made a success of his life. On the other hand, it puts everyone in a position to understand that reality alone is reliable; that dreams, expectations and hopes serve to define a man only as deceptive dreams, abortive hopes, expectations unfulfilled; that is to say, they define him negatively, not positively. Nevertheless, when one says, “You are nothing else but what you live,” it does not imply that an artist is to be judged solely by his works of art, for a thousand other things contribute no less to his definition as a man. What we mean to say is that a man is no other than a series of undertakings, that he is the sum, the organisation, the set of relations that constitute these undertakings.

>**但是贫血的人并不因此而是个懦夫，因为使人成为懦夫的是放弃或者让步的行为；而气质并不是一种行动。一个人成为懦夫是根据他做的事情决定的。**人们无形中感觉到，而且感到骇异的，是因为我们笔下的那种懦夫被描绘成因为是懦夫而有罪。人们喜欢的是，一个人天生就是懦夫或者英雄。…… 而存在主义者却说，是懦夫把自己变成懦夫，是英雄把自己变成英雄；而且这种可能性是永远存在的，即懦夫可以振作起来，不再成为懦夫，而英雄也可以不再成为英雄。**要紧的是整个承担责任，而不是通过某一特殊事例或者某一特殊行动就作为你的全部。**
>
>But the man whose blood is poor is not a coward for all that, for what produces cowardice is the act of giving up or giving way; and a temperament is not an action. A coward is defined by the deed that he has done. What people feel obscurely, and with horror, is that the coward as we present him is guilty of being a coward. What people would prefer would be to be born either a coward or a hero...Whereas the existentialist says that the coward makes himself cowardly, the hero makes himself heroic; and that there is always a possibility for the coward to give up cowardice and for the hero to stop being a hero. **What counts is the total commitment, and it is not by a particular case or particular action that you are committed altogether.**

>但是人道主义还有另一个意义，其基本内容是这样的：人始终处在自身之外，人靠把自己投出并消失在自身之外而使人存在；另一方面，人是靠追求超越的目的才得以存在。既然人是这样超越自己的，而且只在超越自己这方面掌握客体（objects），他本身就是他的超越的中心。除掉人的宇宙外，人的主观性宇宙外，没有别的宇宙。这种构成人的超越性（不是如上帝是超越的那样理解，而是作为超越自己理解）和主观性（指人不是关闭在自身以内而是永远处在人的宇宙里）的关系——这就是我们叫做的存在主义的人道主义。之所以是人道主义，因为我们提醒人除了他自己外，别无立法者；由于听任他怎样做，他就必须为自己作出决定；还有，由于我们指出人不能返求诸己，而必须始终在自身之外寻求一个解放（自己）的或者体现某种特殊（理想）的目标，人才能体现自己真正是人。

>But there is another sense of the word, of which the fundamental meaning is this: Man is all the time outside of himself: it is in projecting and losing himself beyond himself that he makes man to exist; and, on the other hand, it is by pursuing transcendent aims that he himself is able to exist. Since man is thus self-surpassing, and can grasp objects only in relation to his self-surpassing, he is himself the heart and center of his transcendence. There is no other universe except the human universe, the universe of human subjectivity. This relation of transcendence as constitutive of man (not in the sense that God is transcendent, but in the sense of self-surpassing) with subjectivity (in such a sense that man is not shut up in himself but forever present in a human universe) – it is this that we call existential humanism. This is humanism, because we remind man that there is no legislator but himself; that he himself, thus abandoned, must decide for himself; also because we show that it is not by turning back upon himself, but always by seeking, beyond himself, an aim which is one of liberation or of some particular realisation, that man can realize himself as truly human.
