#The Story of Art

The first time I've tried to read this book is the earlier stage of COVID-19. I was locked in home and want to learn something new, and someone recommended me the *art and illusion*. It is so obscure and I tried my best but just read dozens of pages. However, here I am again :) Hope this time I can finish most part of this book.
